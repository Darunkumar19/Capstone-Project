        <p class="text">Monkey D. Luffy, the fearless captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, is a young pirate with an unshakable dream—to become the Pirate King.
            Since childhood, he has admired the legendary pirate Shanks, who not only saved him but also entrusted him with his treasured straw hat, symbolizing their promise to meet again at the pinnacle of piracy.
            Luffy’s journey began in the East Blue, where he set sail alone, determined to gather a strong crew and reach the Grand Line.
            His carefree attitude and relentless optimism make him a natural leader, earning him loyal comrades willing to follow him through any storm.</p>

    <div class="section right">
        <p class="text">One of Luffy’s greatest strengths lies in his Devil Fruit ability, the Gum-Gum Fruit, which grants his body rubber-like properties.
            Over time, he has developed powerful techniques like Gear Second, Gear Third, and the formidable Gear Fifth, pushing his limits to take down the strongest foes.
            Beyond his physical power, Luffy’s greatest weapon is his indomitable will—he refuses to back down, even in the face of overwhelming odds.
            Whether battling warlords, emperors, or the oppressive World Government, he always fights for freedom and justice, embodying the very essence of a true pirate.</p>

        <p class="text">Luffy’s journey has been filled with incredible feats that cement his status as one of the strongest pirates of his era.
            He has defeated some of the most fearsome opponents, including Crocodile in Alabasta, Rob Lucci in Enies Lobby, and Doflamingo in Dressrosa.
            His greatest triumph came in Wano, where he awakened his true Devil Fruit powers and, with his Gear Fifth form, managed to defeat Kaido—the strongest creature in the world—liberating the nation in the process.
            Luffy has also declared war on the World Government by ringing the Ox Bell and breaking into Marineford, proving he is a force that cannot be ignored.
            With his latest bounty soaring past 3 billion berries, Luffy is no longer just a rising star—he is an Emperor of the Sea, standing alongside legends like Shanks and Blackbeard as he moves closer to claiming the One Piece.</p>
