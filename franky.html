        <p class="text">Franky, the shipwright of the Straw Hat Pirates, is a cyborg with a larger-than-life personality and an unmatched talent for shipbuilding.
            Originally the leader of the Franky Family in Water 7, he was once a rebellious ship dismantler before embracing his destiny as a master craftsman.
            Trained by the legendary shipwright Tom, who built Gol D. Roger’s Oro Jackson, Franky inherited his mentor’s dream of creating a ship that would sail to the ends of the world.
            That dream became a reality when he built the Thousand Sunny, the Straw Hats' ultimate vessel
            With his boisterous attitude, signature "Super!" catchphrase, and unwavering loyalty, Franky is the crew’s technological genius and one of its strongest fighters.</p>

        <p class="text">After modifying his own body with cybernetic enhancements, Franky possesses incredible strength, durability, and a variety of built-in weapons.
            His mechanical upgrades include powerful rocket punches, laser beams, and the ability to transform into different battle modes, such as the mighty Franky Shogun.
            His engineering skills also extend beyond himself—he has designed and built multiple weapons, vehicles, and defenses for the crew.
            During the two-year time skip, he upgraded himself even further, integrating futuristic technology from Dr. Vegapunk’s abandoned lab, making him even more of a powerhouse.</p>

        <p class="text">Franky’s feats as both a fighter and a shipwright are legendary.
            He was instrumental in the Straw Hats’ battle against CP9, defeating Fukurou and helping Robin escape Enies Lobby.
            In the Thriller Bark arc, he played a crucial role in the crew’s fight against Oars. During the Wano arc, he showcased his full power by going head-to-head with Sasaki, a high-ranking officer of the Beast Pirates, and defeating him with the radical power of Franky Shogun.
            His greatest contribution, however, is the creation of the Thousand Sunny—a ship built to withstand the dangers of the Grand Line and carry the crew to the end of their journey.
            With his combination of raw strength, engineering genius, and undying loyalty, Franky continues to be an essential part of the Straw Hat Pirates.</p>
