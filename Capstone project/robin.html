        <p class="text">Nico Robin, the archaeologist of the Straw Hat Pirates, is one of the most intelligent and mysterious members of the crew.
            From a young age, she was fascinated by history, growing up in Ohara, the world’s leading center for archaeological research.
            However, her life took a tragic turn when the World Government destroyed her homeland for studying the forbidden Poneglyphs.
            Branded a criminal, she spent her childhood on the run, working with dangerous organizations to survive. Despite her cold and independent nature at first, she eventually found true belonging with the Straw Hat Pirates, who accepted her unconditionally.
            Her dream is to uncover the true history of the world by deciphering the Rio Poneglyph and finding the lost civilization of the Void Century.</p>

        <p class="text">Robin possesses the power of the Flower-Flower Fruit, allowing her to sprout extra limbs on any surface, including her enemies.
            This ability makes her a formidable fighter, as she can immobilize or break opponents with her signature techniques like "Clutch" and "Gigantesco Mano".
            Over time, she has refined her Devil Fruit abilities, creating giant limbs and even forming full-body duplicates of herself.
            In addition to her combat skills, Robin is an invaluable asset to the crew for her vast knowledge of history, ancient languages, and world affairs.
            As the only known survivor capable of reading Poneglyphs, she is a key figure in uncovering the truth hidden by the World Government.</p>

        <p class="text">Robin has played a crucial role in some of the Straw Hats’ greatest moments.
            She helped defeat Crocodile and Baroque Works in Alabasta, aided in deciphering the Poneglyph in Skypiea, and played a key role in uncovering secrets about the Road Poneglyphs.
            Her defining moment came in Enies Lobby, where she chose to live after years of running, leading to the crew’s legendary rescue mission against CP9.
            During the Wano arc, she showcased her true power by defeating Black Maria, one of Kaido’s top officers, using her fearsome Demonio Fleur transformation.
            As the world’s most wanted archaeologist, Robin remains one of the greatest threats to the World Government, bringing the Straw Hats closer to discovering the secrets of the One Piece.</p>
