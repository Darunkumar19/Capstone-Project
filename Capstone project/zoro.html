        <p class="text">Roronoa Zoro, the swordsman of the Straw Hat Pirates, is a master of the Three-Sword Style and Luffy's most loyal crewmate.
            From a young age, he trained relentlessly to become the world’s strongest swordsman, a promise he made to his childhood friend, Kuina.
            His dedication to his goal is unshakable, and he follows Luffy not just as a captain but as the man who will lead him to the top.
            Though often serious and stoic, Zoro is a warrior with a deep sense of honor, willing to risk everything for his crew and his own ideals.</p>

    <div class="section right">
        <p class="text">Zoro wields three powerful swords, including the legendary Enma, a blade once used by Kozuki Oden.
            His monstrous strength and endurance allow him to fight enemies that most would fear, and he continues to push his limits, developing devastating techniques like the Three Thousand Worlds and Ashura.
            His battle instincts and mastery of Haki have made him one of the strongest members of the crew, often taking on the second-in-command of enemy forces.
            His dream is to surpass Dracule Mihawk, the world's greatest swordsman, and he relentlessly trains to achieve this goal.</p>

        <p class="text">Throughout his journey, Zoro has proven himself as one of the deadliest swordsmen in the world, overcoming near-impossible challenges.
            He defeated the indestructible Mr. 1 in Alabasta, stood against Kaku of CP9 in Enies Lobby, and sliced through Pica in Dressrosa.
            One of his greatest moments of loyalty came at Thriller Bark, where he endured all of Luffy’s pain and exhaustion, refusing to let his captain suffer.
            In Wano, he unlocked the advanced form of Conqueror’s Haki, allowing him to scar Kaido—a feat only achieved by the strongest warriors.
            After defeating King, Kaido’s right-hand man, Zoro has cemented his place as one of the world’s most formidable swordsmen.
            As he continues his journey, he moves one step closer to surpassing Mihawk and becoming the greatest swordsman in history.</p>
