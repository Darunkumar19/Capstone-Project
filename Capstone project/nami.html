        <p class="text">Nami, the navigator of the Straw Hat Pirates, is one of the most skilled cartographers and weather experts in the world.
            Growing up in Cocoyasi Village under the oppression of the Arlong Pirates, she developed a deep hatred for pirates until she met Luffy, who changed her perspective forever.
            Her dream is to create a complete map of the world, a goal that fuels her adventurous spirit. Despite not being a fighter in the traditional sense, Nami plays a crucial role in the crew with her intelligence, navigation skills, and strategic thinking.
            She is often seen as the voice of reason in the Straw Hat Pirates, balancing out the reckless tendencies of her crewmates.</p>

    <div class="section right">
        <p class="text">As the crew’s navigator, Nami has guided the Straw Hats through some of the most dangerous seas, including the unpredictable Grand Line and the deadly New World.
            Her ability to read and predict weather patterns is unmatched, allowing the crew to navigate through storms and dangerous waters with precision.
            Over time, she has also become a capable combatant, wielding her Clima-Tact, a weapon designed by Usopp that manipulates the weather.
            With upgrades like the Sorcery Clima-Tact and Zeus, a former Homie from Big Mom, Nami has transformed into a powerful fighter who can summon lightning, create mirages, and control the battlefield in her own unique way.</p>

        <p class="text">Despite being physically weaker than most of her crewmates, Nami has achieved incredible feats that prove she is an invaluable member of the crew.
            She played a key role in the defeat of Arlong, leading to the liberation of her village. In Enies Lobby, she defeated Kalifa of CP9, showcasing her growth as a warrior.
            During the Whole Cake Island arc, she used her tactical mind to outmaneuver Big Mom’s forces, even temporarily controlling Zeus, a living thundercloud. In Wano, she officially claimed Zeus as her own, greatly boosting her offensive power.
            Her most notable victory came when she defeated Ulti, a member of the Beast Pirates, using a devastating lightning strike.
            With her intelligence, combat skills, and unbreakable spirit, Nami continues to prove why she is an essential part of the Straw Hat Pirates.</p>
