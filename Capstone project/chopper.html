        <p class="text">Tony Tony Chopper, the doctor of the Straw Hat Pirates, is a reindeer who gained human-like abilities after eating the Human-Human Fruit.
            Originally an outcast among both reindeer and humans, he was taken in by Dr. Hiriluk, who taught him the value of hope and the power of medicine.
            After Hiriluk’s death, Chopper trained under Dr. Kureha, becoming a skilled doctor despite his young age.
            Though often seen as the crew’s adorable mascot, he is a brilliant physician capable of curing deadly illnesses and treating even the most severe injuries.
            His dream is to become a doctor who can cure any disease, traveling the world to expand his medical knowledge.</p>

        <p class="text">Chopper’s Devil Fruit abilities allow him to transform into multiple forms, each suited for different situations.
            His Brain Point enhances his intelligence, while his Heavy Point gives him incredible strength. With his Rumble Ball, he unlocks additional transformations, including the monstrous Monster Point, which grants him immense power at the cost of control.
            After two years of training on Torino Kingdom, he mastered his transformations, no longer requiring the Rumble Ball for most of them.
            In addition to his physical abilities, his knowledge of medicine and his ability to create antidotes make him one of the most valuable members of the crew.</p>

        <p class="text">Despite his small size, Chopper has achieved incredible feats throughout his journey.
            In Drum Island, he defeated Wapol’s army and helped liberate his homeland, proving himself as a warrior and a doctor.
            In Enies Lobby, he unleashed Monster Point for the first time, overwhelming CP9’s Kumadori. During the Whole Cake Island arc, he outwitted Big Mom’s forces and helped in the crew’s escape.
            His greatest medical achievement came in Udon Prison during the Wano arc, where he created an antidote for Queen’s deadly Ice Oni virus, saving countless lives.
            Though often underestimated, Chopper continues to prove that he is not just a cute mascot but a true warrior and doctor of the Straw Hat Pirates.</p>
