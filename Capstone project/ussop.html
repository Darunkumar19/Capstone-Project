        <p class="text">Usopp, the sniper of the Straw Hat Pirates, is a master marksman and a storyteller with a heart full of dreams.
            Inspired by his pirate father, Yasopp, Usopp always wanted to become a brave warrior of the sea, despite his natural cowardice.
            Initially a prankster and liar in Syrup Village, he found true purpose when he joined Luffy’s crew, determined to prove his worth.
            While he lacks superhuman strength like his crewmates, Usopp makes up for it with his intelligence, creativity, and incredible sniping skills.
            His humor and exaggerated tales bring a lighthearted dynamic to the crew, but underneath it all, he possesses an unbreakable will.</p>

    <div class="section right">
        <p class="text">Usopp fights using a wide variety of slingshots, specialized ammunition, and gadgets that he constantly upgrades.
            From explosive stars to pop greens that unleash plants in battle, he has developed a unique and unpredictable fighting style.
            His greatest strength, however, lies in his strategic thinking—he can analyze enemy weaknesses, set traps, and outwit much stronger opponents.
            Despite often being scared in battle, he always finds the courage to stand his ground when it matters most, proving time and again that he is a true warrior of the sea.</p>

        <p class="text">Throughout his journey, Usopp has achieved remarkable feats that showcase his growth.
            In Enies Lobby, he took on the identity of “Sogeking” and famously burned the World Government’s flag, declaring war alongside his crew.
            He played a key role in taking down Perona in Thriller Bark and Sugar in Dressrosa, the latter of which earned him the title of "God Usopp" among revolutionaries.
            In Wano, he fearlessly fought against the Beast Pirates and protected the injured Kin’emon and Kiku despite being outmatched. His sharpshooting skills have turned the tide in countless battles, proving that strength isn’t just about brute force but also about intelligence and heart.
            With each adventure, Usopp continues to push past his fears, moving closer to his dream of becoming a legendary warrior of the sea.</p>
