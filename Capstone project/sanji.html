        <p class="text">Sanji, the cook of the Straw Hat Pirates, is not only a master chef but also one of the crew’s strongest fighters.
            Raised in the Baratie under the guidance of Red-Leg Zeff, he developed his dream of finding the legendary All Blue—a sea where fish from every ocean gather.
            Unlike most pirates, Sanji values food above all else, believing that no one should ever go hungry, even his enemies.
            His chivalrous nature and refusal to harm women, no matter the situation, define his character, making him both noble and stubborn.
            Despite his flirtatious antics, he is deeply loyal to his captain and crew, ready to put his life on the line for them.</p>

    <div class="section right">
        <p class="text">Sanji is an expert in Black Leg Style, a powerful martial art that relies solely on kicks to keep his hands free for cooking.
            His training under Zeff gave him inhuman leg strength, allowing him to break steel and overpower enemies with devastating techniques like Diable Jambe, which ignites his legs in flames.
            After two years of training in the Kamabakka Kingdom, he improved his physical endurance, speed, and Haki abilities, making him one of the fastest and most formidable fighters in the crew.
            In Wano, he unlocked his genetic enhancements from the Germa lineage, gaining an exoskeleton and greater durability, further increasing his combat prowess.</p>

        <p class="text">Sanji’s list of achievements is as impressive as his culinary skills.
            He played a crucial role in defeating powerful foes like Mr. 2 in Alabasta, Jabra of CP9 in Enies Lobby, and Queen, one of Kaido’s top commanders, in Wano.
            His strategic mind helped the crew escape countless dangerous situations, from rescuing Robin in Enies Lobby to stalling Big Mom’s forces during Whole Cake Island.
            His greatest moment of resilience came when he stood up against his own family, rejecting the Germa 66 bloodline and proving that he is more than just his lineage.
            With his strength, intelligence, and unwavering loyalty, Sanji continues to solidify himself as one of the greatest fighters and chefs in the One Piece world.</p>
