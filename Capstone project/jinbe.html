        <p class="text">Jinbe, the helmsman of the Straw Hat Pirates, is a master of Fish-Man Karate and one of the most honorable warriors of the sea.
            As a former Warlord of the Sea and the ex-captain of the Sun Pirates, he has long fought for the coexistence of humans and fish-men, carrying on the will of his late captain, Fisher Tiger.
            Despite his serious and disciplined demeanor, Jinbe has a deep sense of loyalty and camaraderie, fully dedicating himself to any cause he believes in.
            His ultimate dream is to see a world where fish-men are treated as equals, free from discrimination and oppression.</p>

            During the Whole Cake Island arc, he fearlessly declared his allegiance to Luffy, standing up to Big Mom and ensuring the crew’s safe escape.
